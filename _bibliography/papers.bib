abstract = {Abstract Lead-free halide double perovskite (HDP) Cs2AgBiBr6 has set a benchmark for research in HDP photoelectric applications due to its attractive optoelectronic properties. However, its narrow absorption range is a key limitation of this material. Herein, a novel dopant, palladium (Pd), is doped into Cs2AgBiBr6 and significantly extends the absorption to ≈1400 nm. Pd2+ ions are partially doped in the host lattice, most probably replacing Ag atoms and introducing a sub-bandgap state within the host bandgap, as indicated by the combination of spectroscopical measurements and theoretical calculations. Importantly, this sub-bandgap state extends the photoresponse of Cs2AgBiBr6 up to the NIR-II region of 1300 nm, setting a new record for HDPs. This work demonstrates a novel and efficient dopant for HDPs and highlights the effectiveness of employing a sub-bandgap to broaden the absorption of HDPs, shedding new light on tailoring large bandgap HDPs for NIR optoelectronic applications.},

abstract={Long-wavelength near-infrared light-emitting diodes (NIR LEDs) with peak emission wavelengths beyond 900{\thinspace}nm are of critical importance for various applications including night vision, biomedical imaging, sensing and optical communications. However, the low radiance and poor operational stability of state-of-the-art long-wavelength NIR LEDs based on soft materials remain the most critical factors limiting their practical applications. Here we develop NIR LEDs emitting beyond 900{\thinspace}nm with improved performance through the rational manipulation of p doping in all-inorganic tin perovskites (CsSnI3) by retarding and controlling the crystallization process of perovskite precursors in tin-rich conditions. The resulting NIR LEDs exhibit a peak emission wavelength at 948{\thinspace}nm, high radiance of 226{\thinspace}W{\thinspace}sr−1{\thinspace}m−2 and long operational half-lifetime of 39.5{\thinspace}h at a high constant current density of 100{\thinspace}mA{\thinspace}cm−2. Our demonstration of efficient and stable NIR LEDs operating at high current densities may also open up new opportunities towards electrically pumped lasers.},

title = {First-principles investigations of orthorhombic-cubic phase transition and its effect on thermoelectric properties in cobalt-based ternary alloys},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {We screened six cobalt-based 18-VEC systems CoVSi, CoNbSi, CoTaSi (Si-group) and CoVGe, CoNbGe, CoTaGe (Ge-group) by the first-principles approach, with the motivation of stabilizing these orthorhombic phases into the cubic symmetry—favorable for thermoelectrics. Remarkably, it was found that the Ge-group is energetically more favorable in the cubic symmetry than the hitherto orthorhombic phase. We account the cubic ground state of the Si-group to the interplay of internal pressure and covalent interactions. The principle of reducing covalent interactions will provide insight and could be vital in speeding the search of missing cubic half-Heusler alloys. Meanwhile, the calculated transport properties of all the systems on p -type doping, except CoVSi, are more promising than the well-known CoTiSb. We also provide conservative estimates of the figure of merit, exceeding the CoTiSb. Based on our findings, we suggest possible new phases of ternary compounds for thermoelectric applications.}
